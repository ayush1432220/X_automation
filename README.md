X Scheduler is a full-stack web application designed to empower users by allowing them to authenticate with their X (Twitter) account and schedule tweets to be posted at a future date and time. It features a secure and scalable backend built with NestJS and a modern, responsive frontend built with Next.js and Material-UI.

This project demonstrates a complete end-to-end development workflow, including third-party API integration, secure authentication, database management, and automated background tasks.

‚ú® Core Features
Secure OAuth 2.0 Authentication: A full, secure OAuth 2.0 flow with X (Twitter) to safely connect user accounts.

Intuitive Tweet Scheduling: A user-friendly interface to compose tweets and select a precise date and time for future posting.

Automated Cron-Based Posting: A reliable backend cron job runs every minute to check for and publish scheduled tweets automatically.

User Dashboard: A central dashboard where users can view lists of their upcoming "Scheduled" tweets and a history of their "Posted" tweets.

Robust NestJS Backend: A modular and scalable server-side architecture.

Modern Next.js Frontend: A fast, responsive user interface built with the Next.js App Router.

Token Management: Handles access token expiration and uses refresh tokens to maintain a persistent and secure user session.
